Wikimedia Deutschland is the German chapter of the global [Wikimedia movement](https://www.wikimedia.org/). Our technical focus is on [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/), the [Wikibase ecosystem](https://wikiba.se/) and software that serves the German speaking and wider Wikimedia community.

## Our projects

### Wikidata

A collaboratively edited multilingual knowledge graph that powers Wikipedia, Wikivoyage, Wiktionary, Wikisource, and many other sites and services beyond just Wikimedia projects! See [wikidata.org](https://www.wikidata.org).

### Wikibase Suite

Dockerized deployment of Wikibase, the technology behind Wikidata. It alows you to host your very own linked open data knowledge base. See [installation guide on MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikibase/Suite).

### Wikibase Cloud

A fully managed Wikibase instance that provides the support needed for those who want to have their own knowledge graph quickly and easily. See [wikibase.cloud](https://www.wikibase.cloud).

### Fundraising Tech

Software that powers Wikimedia Deutschland's fundraising efforts including apis, user interfaces, banners and more. See [spenden.wikimedia.de](https://spenden.wikimedia.de/).

### Technical Wishes

A dedicated team that builds new and improved features for the MediaWiki community (our code is hosted on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/wmde) and Gerrit). See [our page on Meta-Wiki](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/WMDE_Technical_Wishes).

## Our movement

The Wikimedia movement is the global community of contributors to the Wikimedia projects, including Wikipedia, Wikidata and so many others. There are global chapters all over the world that maintain the projects for their communities and create software and tools for all to benefit from. For those looking to learn more about software at the Wikimedia movement, please see the [Wikimedia Foundation](https://github.com/wikimedia) and [Wikidata](https://github.com/Wikidata) GitHub organizations.
